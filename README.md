Fine-tune a pretrained model. This repo show's how to fetch and fine tune the pretrained Model according to our own needs.
# About Fine Tunning:
-There are significant benefits to using a pretrained model. It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks. When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique. In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice:

-Fine-tune a pretrained model with ðŸ¤— Transformers Trainer.
-Fine-tune a pretrained model in TensorFlow with Keras.
-Fine-tune a pretrained model in native PyTorch.
